My original plan was to start working on upgrading Volta in MacPorts from version 1.x to version 2.x. I actually contributed this package a few years ago! I've forgotten absolutely everything about MacPorts since then, because I went back to using Nix for all my packaging needs. Then why am I event looking into a MacPorts package again? That's a story for another entry.

As is typical for myself, I found creative ways of avoiding the actual task I had in mind for tonight. Instead, while reading the MacPorts contributor guide, I realized that I had never setup the `MANPATH` variable properly for MacPorts. I sat down with just my terminal and read up on some Fish builtins (`man contains`, `man if`, `man set`) and made sure that the necessary `/opt/...` path was from now on included in the `MANPATH` variable from my Fish config. It was very enjoyable to read and understand without any context switching and without relying on AI. But I digress again.

Naturally, since I use Nix for even my dotfiles, I had to call `home-manager switch` -- which promptly failed with an error. You see, I had also updated my Nix Flake inputs tonight. Why did I do that, knowing that any update might cause problems? Well, why not?

`hledger` 1.41 is currently broken (see this [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/377564)), which I was able to work around with an overlay. I then also had to comment out `oils-for-unix` because of [this issue](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues/2226).

Figuring out how to fix `hledger`, making sure I was using the most recent Lix version to avoid rebuilding it on my machine, and some other cleanup here and there ended up taking the whole evening. So that's that.
