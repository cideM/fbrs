Remember when it was all the rage to write articles about functional programming in Javascript by explaining how you can chain `.map`, `.filter` and `.reduce` on lists? I hated that. I think that it conditions people into thinking that functional programming is all about list comprehensions.

In Advent of Code (AoC) it's easy to accidentally keep huge lists in memory to the point where garbage collection takes up most of you CPU power and the program grinds to a crawl. So people abandon things like `.map` and `.find` in favor of a simple loop. In the loop body they can effectively compose different operations together. And I have nothing against that whatsoever. In fact, I struggle with expressing problems in functional languages and find it much easier to get a working solution in Lua.

But I think that it is very possible to write somewhat efficient code that doesn't waste memory on recreating the same list over and over again. Unfortunately, I think that Janet doesn't make that easy for you. In theory Janet has great coroutines. For example, you can create a stream of items using `(generate [_ :iterate true] (math/random)`. But in my testing so far it seems that passing that into functions like `map` and `filter` then eagerly evaluates the entire thing.

```janet
(->> (gen-stuff input)
     (map foo)
     (filter bar))
```

In my testing on AoC day 6 (the first one where you walk around in a grid), the imperative version using `loop` used about 80MB, the version that kicks things off with a generator and then runs this through various list comprehenions immediately took up around 10GB of memory.

I'm not saying it can't be done in Janet. You can of course create versions of these functions that are coroutine aware, but it would have been nice if the standard library functions would do that automatically for you.
