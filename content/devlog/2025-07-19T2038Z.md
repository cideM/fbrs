I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 because I wanted to run a temperature sensor. Mostly
so I can check how effective my portable air conditioning unit from DeLonghi
actually is in my apartment.

I naively assumed that v5 of the Pi (as opposed to my ancient v3) would support
video over USB-C, or at least have a standard USB-C port. I also assumed I
could just flash Home Assistant onto a USB stick and it would magically install
itself onto the SSD I got (together with the M.2 HAT).

My assumptions were all wrong.

It has a micro HDMI port (didn't know that existed), USB-C is for power, and,
as far as I can tell, plugging in a USB stick won't do anything.

So now I ordered a cable, a SD card, an SD card adapter, and I also added a SD
card reader for good measure. I now expect NOTHING to work, so I won't assume
that my MacBook Pro's SD card reader will work with these cards. Hence the USB
pluggable SD card reader.

I'm sure the Pi is great, but right now I just want to throw it in the trash.
