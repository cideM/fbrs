I was thinking about this recently while doing some Leetcode binary search problems. For this particular problem I split it up into two sub problems, each of which used binary search.

[This Stack Overflow answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297357/is-olog-n-olog-n-on) explains it nicely. Constant, multiplicative factors don't matter much for Big O notation. So the sub problems can also be thought of as `O(2 * log n)`, where the constant factor of 2 doesn't matter.

During this exercise I also came across a cool graphing tool called [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) which could be very handy for visualizing and intuitively understanding some of these concepts.
