Hi, I'm Florian! :wave:

I created this blog many years ago, because I wanted to make myself look better
online. But that's not the kind of content I want to read online, so why would
I add to this growing pile of self-marketing bullshit?

The most satisfying posts I've written to date are the ones about
[`unliftio`](@/unliftio.md) and
[`Compose`](@/applicative_compose.md), because they were both
relatively well researched and I felt confident in what I had to say.

Unfortunately, creating content like that takes more time and effort than I'm
usually willing to spare.

I want this to be a space where I can share whatever is interesting, as long as
I never speak from authority on topics I don't understand.

While this blog started as a programming blog, I intend to also write about
video games, cycling and life in general. Consider it an extended, public
journal if you will.

Also, I'm a physician by training and a software engineer by choosing.
