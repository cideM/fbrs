Hi, I'm Florian! :wave:

I'm a software developer who mostly does web stuff at work and likes to play
around with functional programming stuff for fun. I like things like Nix,
Haskell and Clojure.

I also spend ~~too much~~ just the right amount of time with sort of minimalistic
desktop environments. Right now I'm running Sway on my NixOS machine. That's
also why I don't have screen sharing :sweat_smile:.

I'm trying to learn Japanese, love music like Plini and have been a video gamer
for over 20 years now.

Feel free to contact me at yuuki@protonmail.com
