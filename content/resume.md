I'm a physician turned software engineer with over 4 years of experience in building web applications. I'm a full stack developer with equal experience in front end and backend development. But I also enjoy working on matters related to building and deploying code. I'm self-taught and extremely driven, and consider programming both job and favorite pastime.
