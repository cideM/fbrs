I'm a physician turned software engineer with over 5 years of experience in
building scalable web applications. My main area of expertise is back end
services running in Kubernetes but I feel equally comfortable working on front
end code or CLI tools. I'm self-taught and extremely driven, and consider
programming both as a job and favorite pastime.

Since I'm a big fan of reproducible software and declarative configuration,
most of my open source efforts now focus on [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS).

## Skills

- Work with it every day: **Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript, GraphQL**
- Could jump in and quickly get up to speed: Haskell, Lua, Nix, Typescript
