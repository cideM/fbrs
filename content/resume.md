I'm a physician turned software engineer with over 5 years of experience in
building scalable web applications. My main area of expertise is back end
services running in Kubernetes but I feel equally comfortable working on front
end code or CLI tools. I'm self-taught and extremely driven, and consider
programming both as a job and favorite pastime.

Since I'm a big fan of reproducible software and declarative configuration,
most of my open source efforts now focus on [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS).

## Skills

- Work with it every day: **Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript/Typescript, GraphQL**
- Could jump in and quickly get up to speed: Haskell, Lua, Nix, Janet
- Some familiarity: Rust, Clojure

## Experience

### Tech Lead Content API
<div role="doc-subtitle">AMBOSS | Since November 2024</div>
- With the rise of AI our content delivery pipeline needed a complete overhaul. I'm leading the Content API part of the initiative as the tech lead of a small team consisting of three developers (including myself). This includes the typical duties you'd expect from such a role: plan project timelines, align with other teams and stake holders, write lots of proof of concepts and Request for Comments documents to scope out the system architecture, and so on.
- The Content API we're building is a highly generic Go service that uses code generation to generate types, structs and resolvers from our content management system (think of it like Hasura) 
- One of my highlights so far was creating a library that generates JSON Schema documents from Typescript types
- Interim Engineering Manager in addition to the tech lead role

### Senior Software Engineer
